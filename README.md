# Randomized_Optimization

Implement four randomized optimization algorithms to solve three optimization problems.
1. Random Hill Climbing
2. Simulated Annealing
3. Genetic Algorithm
4. MIMIC 

Three optimization problems:
1. Suppose we want to find the binary string of length 10 that maximizes the number of 1's. In other words, we want to find the binary string x that maximizes the objective function f(x) = number of 1's in x. 
2. Suppose we have a game board that consists of a 5x5 grid of squares. Each square is either black or white. We want to find the arrangement of colors that maximizes the number of pairs of adjacent squares that have the same color.
3. Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is to find the shortest possible route that visits a set of cities exactly once and returns to the starting city. Let's consider an example with 5 cities: A, B, C, D, and E.
